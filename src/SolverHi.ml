(* We now set up the applicative functor API, or combinator API, to the
   solver. The constraint construction phase and the witness decoding phase
   are packaged together, with two benefits: 1- the syntax of constraints and
   witnesses, as well as the details of write-once references, are hidden; 2-
   the client can write code in a compositional and declarative style, under
   the illusion that constructing a query immediately gives rise to an
   answer. *)

(* The client is allowed to construct objects of type ['a co]. Such an object is
   a pair of a constraint and a continuation. It is evaluated in two phases. In
   the first phase, the constraint is solved. In the second phase, the continuation
   is invoked. It is allowed to examine the witness, and must produce a value of
   type ['a]. *)
