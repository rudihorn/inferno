  (* Evaluation. *)

  (* [solve rectypes c] evaluates the constraint [c]. The flag [rectypes] tells
     whether recursive types are considered legal. The constraint [c] is solved.
     If a term variable [x] is out of scope, [Unbound x] is raised. If the
     constraint is unsatisfiable, then [Unify] or [Cycle] is raised. ([Cycle]
     can be raised only if [rectypes] is [false].) After the constraint has been
     found to be satisfiable, it is evaluated (in particular, the functions that
     were supplied as arguments to [map] during the construction of the
     constraint are invoked) and a final result of type ['a] is produced. *)

  (* [solve] destroys its argument. It is not permitted to call [solve] twice
     on the same constraint. *)

  (* The argument to [solve] must have an application of [let0] at its root. This
     is a way of ensuring that the final result has no free type variables. *)
